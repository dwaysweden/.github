# Hey, this is us 👋
We are **Digital Way** or [***dway***](https://dway.se) that we usually say. We are constantly looking for new projects and are open to collaborations.
Almost all our projects are powered by open source. We have chosen to specialize in the automotive industry 🚗 and help several companies with smart and simple solutions, but of course we also help companies in other industries. 🤖🪄
